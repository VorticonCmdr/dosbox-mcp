"""Protocol version negotiation.

The spec (PROTOCOL.md) is versioned MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; only
"major.minor" travels on the wire. Peers are compatible when the major
matches; the effective contract is the smaller minor. Engines that ship
a features block but predate the mcp_protocol field (da1, da2) are
implicit 1.0, because 1.0 is defined as the surface those releases ship.
